you can see usage examples of the Quadtree in the `src/Examples/` folder, an explanation on how to build the examples is below

# Build Examples
Quadtree examples use SFML in order to display, here is how you should use it:

Download the source files 
```git
git clone git@github.com:StavFaran92/Quadtree.git
```
Once downloaded go into the cloned directory, in order to build the example you will need [cmake](https://cmake.org/download/),
simply type 
```git
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
```

if everything worked fine a Visual Studio solution has been generated, open `build/Quadtree.sln`
and build the solution.
